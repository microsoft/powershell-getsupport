# Getting PowerShell Support

**This repository is NOT a support platform!**
Its intent is to provide information and tools to aid you in getting better help from whoever you contact for help with PowerShell.

## Official PowerShell Team Support

To receive formal, official support in a PowerShell matter, either open a case with Microsoft Support or [Open an Issue on Github](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues).

Anything you see below can help you provide better information, but this project is not the place to open issues for any problems you have.
